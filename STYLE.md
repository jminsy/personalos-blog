# Blog Style Guide

## Voice
- Conversational, not corporate — write like explaining to a smart friend
- Fun and fascinating — spark curiosity, use vivid analogies
- Confident but honest — share failures and "aha" moments equally
- Show the evolution — AI isn't magic, it's iterative problem-solving

## Tone
- Enthusiastic without hype
- Self-aware humor welcome (we're building an OS for life, that's inherently funny)
- Never preachy or prescriptive — share what works, not what others should do

## Content Rules
- **Topic**: Personal OS only — the system, the philosophy, the build process
- **Angle**: Always show how AI makes life easier/better — that's the thesis
- **Privacy**: NEVER reveal personal info — no real names, locations, employers, finances, or identifiable details
- **Examples**: Use the system itself as the example (tasks, ideas, workflows) — keep content generic enough to not expose private data
- **Screenshots**: Redact any personal content before including

## Structure
- Hook in first 2 sentences — start with a story, surprise, or bold claim
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Code snippets when relevant — devs love seeing the actual implementation
- End with a takeaway or principle — something quotable
- Series footer linking to personalos.hashnode.dev

## Formatting
- Subheadings to break up sections
- Bold for key terms on first use
- Inline code for file names, commands, config
- No walls of text — if a paragraph feels long, split it

## What makes a good post
- A real moment from building the OS (not hypothetical)
- A before/after — what changed and why
- A principle that generalizes beyond our specific system
- Something the reader can think about or try themselves

## What to avoid
- Generic AI hype ("AI will change everything")
- Tutorial format without a story
- Overly technical deep-dives with no payoff
- Anything that reads like documentation
